# PegAI
Beating the Peg IQ game with AI (And other strategies)

I stumbled accross a dusty triangle of pegs while on vacation in Maine. 

These pegs formed this very enfuriating brain teaser game similar to checkers, which
naturally I played for way too long. 

I did ok, but along the way realized that there was definitely some interesting logic involved
in how to get down to one peg consistently. I considered working it out manually, but figured 
this could instead be a good opportunity to get some coding practice in.

So, instead of swimming for the last few hours (so far) I have been working away at trying to beat this really simple game once and for all.

Wish me luck!

So far, I've just coded the functionality of the game, and enabled the computer to play the game with a random strategy. 
This random strategy in and of itself yields some interesting statistical results, which I intend to model in the future. 
I also will add a minmax player, and an ai player.
