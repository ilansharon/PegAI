Beating the Peg IQ game with AI

I stumbled accross a dusty triangle of pegs while on vacation in Maine. 

These pegs formed this very enfuriating brain teaser game similar to checkers, which
naturally I played for way too long. 

I did ok, but along the way realized that there was definitely some interesting logic involved
in how to get down to one peg consistently. I considered working it out manually, but figured this could instead
be a good opportunity to get some coding practice in.

So, instead of swimming for the last few hours (so far) I have been working away at trying to beat this really simple game once and for all.

Wish me luck!
